== Ants

=== basic architecture
mvc pattern with clean separation of ui and model. (controller as needed)

=== game logic
* hill
- home of ants
- created by user
- has initial stock of food
- destroyed by ???

* ant
- is born in a hill (costs foods to "produced" it)
- searches for food when it leaves the hill
- each move consumes some energy
- energy is restored when returned to the hill (consumes food)
- dies when all energy is gone (automatic return to hill at min energy?)
- can carry things back to the hill 

* food
- is created and located manually 
- can be found on the playground
- one location may have multiple food entities (quantity)

=== open items
* collision detection
- consider object size
- performance!
* shared objects
- type of object - eg. HillModel vs HillUi vs Mode
- should eg. AntUi know its model?
* ant ui should show the energy level
* events / model sync
- more generalized types like object creation/deletion, property changes; not more!
- use a generic way to copy properties
* ModelFactory/ViewFactory
- draws object id
- defines the exchangable object type id (decision: prefix of model class name, e.g. AntModel -> "Ant")

=== done items
==== bidirectional event handling
* ui events 
- triggered by user input (mouse, key)
- preprocessing in ui, but no effect

* model events 
- triggered by timer as result of ui events

* Controller
- extract class from main.js
